    Hello and welcome to AnaraScape home of the Anara dungeon generator. Thanks for stopping by, just keep
    in mind this website is still under construction with many features on the way. For now why don't you check
    out the map generator? It was the launching point for this whole website. Check out these samples from the
    prototype:

    You may ask - "Well, other than a map generator what is this site for?"
    <br><br>
    The future vision of AnaraScape is to be the home of my personal fantasy setting Anara. Hopefully one day
    this website will have all the tools needed for Game Masters and Players of TTRPGs to enter the world of
    Anara with their games.
    <br><br>
    I made the core concept of the world over a period of 3 months or so but have never really stopped adding to
    it. I wanted the plane of Anara to be a lower magic setting with a shaded history and plentiful ruins to
    explore containing that history. There are some concepts in Anara that many might find offensive such as
    racist and classist peoples, but Anara was not only influenced by other fantasy settings but also our own
    world. Though the setting has these concepts, that in no way is meant to condone their presence in the
    present day.
    <br><br>
    My creation of Anara was heavily influenced by the works of:
    <br>
    - J. R. R. Tolkien's <em>"Middle-earth"</em>
    <br>
    - Andrzej Sapkowski's <em>"Wiedźmin"</em>
    <br>
    - The <em>"Warhammer"</em> universes
    <br>
    - The <em>"BattleTech"</em> universe
    <br><br>
    The planned future additions to this site include:
    <br>
    - The world map of Anara with some built in tools
    <br>
    - Player Character pages for Game Masters and Players
    <br>
    - Other styles for the map generator
    <br>
    - An NPC and world/city database
    <br>
    - Exp Calculator (DnD)
    <br>
    - Lore index
    <br>
    - Dice roller
    <br><br>
    Until then happy gaming and I hope the maps suit you well!
