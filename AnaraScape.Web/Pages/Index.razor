        Hello and welcome to AnaraScape home of the Anara dungeon generator. Thanks for stopping by, just keep
        in mind this website is still under construction with many features on the way. For now why don't you check
        out the map generator? It was the launching point for this whole website. Checkout these samples too:

        You may ask - "Well, other than a map generator what is this site for?"
        <br><br>
        The future vision of AnaraScape is to be the home of my personal fantasy setting Anara. Hopefully one day
        this website will have all the tools needed for Game Masters and Players of TTRPGs to enter the world of
        Anara with their games.
        <br><br>
        I made the core concept of the world over a period of 3 months or so but have never really stopped adding to
        it. I wanted the plane of Anara to be a lower magic setting with a shaded history and plentiful ruins to
        explore containing that history. There are some concepts in Anara that many might find offensive such as
        racist and classist peoples, but Anara was not only influenced by other fantasy settings but also our own
        world. Though the setting has these concepts, that in no way is ment to condone their pressence in the
        present day.
        <br><br>
        My creation of Anara was heavily influenced by the works of:
        <br>
        - J. R. R. Tolkien's <em>"Middle-earth"</em>
        <br>
        - Andrzej Sapkowski's <em>"Wiedźmin"</em>
        <br>
        - The <em>"Warhammer"</em> universes
        <br>
        - The <em>"BattleTech"</em> universe
        <br><br>
        The planned future addtions to this site include:
        <br>
        - The world map of Anara with some builtin tools
        <br>
        - Player Character pages for Game Masters and Players
        <br>
        - Other styles for the map generator
        <br>
        - An NPC and world/city database
        <br>
        - Exp Calculator (DnD)
        <br>
        - Lore index
        <br>
        - Dice roller
        <br><br>
        Until then happy gaming and I hope the maps suit you well!
